INSTALL
=======

 Build instructions are in the INSTALL file.

 The code for Target Finder was written in Perl with portability in mind. This 
 tool has been tested on the following operating systems and architectures.

 o CENT-OS 5.0 Linux 64-bit and 32-bit (Opteron and Intel Quadcore)
 o RedHat AS 3.0/4.0/5.0 Linux 64-bit and 32-bit (Opteron and Intel Quadcore)
 o Fedora Core 6.0/7.0 Linux 64-bit and 32-bit (AMD 64 X2)
 o SuSE 10.2 Linux 64-bit (AMD 64 X2)
 o Solaris 9 (Sparc)
 o Solaris 8 (Sparc)
 o MacOSX Leopard 10.5.1 (Intel Core2 and PPC)
 o MacOSX Tiger 10.4.7 (Intel Core2 and PPC)



REQUIRMENTS
===========

  - Perl v5.8 (and maybe lower)
  - FASTA35 binaries from (http://fasta.bioch.virginia.edu/fasta_www2/fasta_down.shtml)
  - File::Temp module
  - Getopt::Std module


USAGE
=====

 REQUIRED ARGUMENTS

  -s     Small RNA sequence (either RNA or DNA).
  -d     FASTA-formated sequence file containing potential target sequences.

 OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS

  -q     Query sequence name (DEFAULT = query).
  -c     Prediction score cutoff value (DEFAULT = 4).
  -r     Search reverse strand for targets? (BOOLEAN, DEFAULT=FALSE)
  -h     Shows the help menu.

 OUTPUT

 targetfinder.pl writes all output to the terminal (STOUT). To save the output to a file use
 '>' to redirect output to a file.

  ex.

  ./targetfinder.pl -s UGUGUUCUCAGGUCACCCCUU -d arab_cdna -q miR399a > miR399a_predicted_targets.txt

 Each predicted target site is printed out separately.  The output consists of two parts.  The first is a
 description line and the second is a base-pairing diagram of the target and small RNA (query) sequence.
 The description line contains the query name (query=name), the description line from the target sequence
 database (target=target description), and the target prediction score (score=prediction score).

  ex.

  query=miR399a, target=AT2G33770.1 | Symbol: None |  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, low similarity to u, score=1.5

 The base-pairing diagram has the target site sequence on top in 5'-3' orientation and the query sequence
 on the bottom in 3'-5' orientation.  Between the target site sequece and the query sequence are base pair
 symbols. A ":" (colon) symbol represents an ordinary Watson-Crick base pair, a "." (period) represents
 a G:U base pair, and a " " (space) represents a mismatch.

  ex.

  target  5' UAGGGCAAAUCUUCUUUGGCA 3'
             .:::::::::::.::::::::
  query   3' GUCCCGUUUAGAGGAAACCGU 5'

 If a small RNA is predicted to target a sequence more than once, each target site will be output as
 separate output.  Below is an example of output for miR399a and its target At2g33770.  miR399a has five
 target sites in the 5'UTR of At2g33770.

  query=miR399a, target=AT2G33770.1 | Symbol: None |  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, low similarity to u, score=1.5

  target  5' UAGGGCAAAUCUUCUUUGGCA 3'
             .:::::::::::.::::::::
  query   3' GUCCCGUUUAGAGGAAACCGU 5'

  query=miR399a, target=AT2G33770.1 | Symbol: None |  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, low similarity to u, score=1.5

  target  5' UAGGGCAUAUCUCCUUUGGCA 3'
             .:::::: :::::::::::::
  query   3' GUCCCGUUUAGAGGAAACCGU 5'

  query=miR399a, target=AT2G33770.1 | Symbol: None |  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, low similarity to u, score=1.5

  target  5' UAGAGCAAAUCUCCUUUGGCA 3'
             .:: :::::::::::::::::
  query   3' GUCCCGUUUAGAGGAAACCGU 5'

  query=miR399a, target=AT2G33770.1 | Symbol: None |  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, low similarity to u, score=1.5

  target  5' UUGGGCAAAUCUCCUUUGGCA 3'
             . :::::::::::::::::::
  query   3' GUCCCGUUUAGAGGAAACCGU 5'

  query=miR399a, target=AT2G33770.1 | Symbol: None |  ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family protein, low similarity to u, score=2.5

  target  5' UCGAGCAAAUCUCCUUUGGCA 3'
             . : :::::::::::::::::
  query   3' GUCCCGUUUAGAGGAAACCGU 5'


 targetfinder.pl searches for potential miRNA target sites in a FASTA-formated sequence database
 using three main steps.

  1. The small RNA query sequence is aligned to every sequence in the FASTA-formated sequence
     database using the alignment program FASTA35.

  2. The FASTA35 alignments are converted into RNA duplexes.

  3. Each duplex is scored using a position-dependent scoring matrix.

 FASTA35 is used to identify the best complementary regions between the small RNA query sequence
 and every sequence in the FASTA-formated sequence database.  This script runs FASTA35 with the
 following settings:

  -n     Forces the small RNA query sequence to be treated as nucleotide sequence.
  -H     Suppresses the normal histogram output of FASTA35.
  -Q     Runs FASTA35 in "quiet" mode.
  -f     Gap opening penalty (set to -16).
  -g     Gap extention penalty (set to -10).
  -r     Match reward/mismatch penalty (set to +15/-10).
  -w     Alignment output line length (set to 100).
  -W     Additional sequence context in the output (set to 25).
  -E     The E-value cutoff (set to 100000).
  -i     Limits FASTA35 alignments to reverse complement matches only.
  -U     Changes scoring matrix to allow for G:A, T:C, or U:C matches.
  ktup   Word size for seed matches that FASTA35 uses to build alignments (set to 1).

 FASTA35 output is read directly into this script.  Each alignment is converted to a RNA duplex by
 complementing the small RNA query sequence.  Each RNA duplex is scored using the following scoring
 metric and rule set:

  1. Mismatches, single-nucleotide gaps or single-nucleotide bulges are assesed a penalty of +1.

  2. G:U base pairs are assessed a penalty of +0.5.

  3. Penalty scores are doubled at positions 2-13 relative to the 5' end of the small RNA query sequence.

  4. Duplexes are rejected if they:

     a. have more than one single-nucleotide bulge or gap.
 
     b. have more than seven total mismatches, G:U base pairs, bulges and gaps.

     c. have more than four total mismatches or four total G:U base pairs.
 
 Predicted targets are printed out if they are equal to or lower than the cutoff score specified.

 Note: the -i option limits FASTA35 to reverse complement matches only, but you can use the -r option
       with targetfinder.pl to search both strands of a sequence database. This should be done if the
       database is a genome sequence so that target sites on both strands can be found.
