[better to finish them after thanks giving]

1. GO tools for GO analysis, 
	1.1 structure [finished] 
	1.2 debug and run  GO analysis 

2. SNP tools for RNASeq SNP analysis. 
	2.1 finish basic function (finished)
	2.2 add debug paramter to run script directly
	2.3 add remove duplication code 

3. pathwayTools (can not finished, should be done in xmas)
	add script to parse pathway tools files. 
	add steps 

4. sRNA analysis
	remove barcode (3' and 5') (Finished)
	remove short (Finished)

5. mRNATools
	test AHRD functions (Finished)

============================================
   plan -- add Q20 Function, range function
   clip from 5' and 3' function by the end of this Sept 2014
   insert miRNA identification pipeline, debug, 
   insert sPARTA to it, debug
   insert ta-si analysis to it debug
   by the end of 2014, check if there is any pipeline could be used for improve 24nt sRNA analysis
